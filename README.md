## Welcome to keroppi

This repository is to keep a record of my thoughts and what I have done in daily life and work. 

### Introduction

Basically, keroppi keeps a record of my exploration in Machine Learning, NLP and AI, and more specifically, some actionable practice in healthcare, marketing and insurance industry using open source data sets.


## P1 - NLP practice on Insurance QA corpus

### Data source

Insurance QA from [github.com/shuzi/insuranceQA]
This data set is originally for supervised QA purpose. However, it is often difficult to get such well organized and labeled data in real business world.

### Practice

Sales dialogue like telemarketing also contains many QA pairs. Thus, some explorations to understand successful sales dialogue has been done using unsupervised learning in NLP. Practice includes some demo models built using medical insurance QA pairs. 

- Medical insurance QA questions clustering using bert as representation model
- Medical insurance QA answers automatic summarization
