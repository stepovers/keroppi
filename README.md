## Introduction

Basically, keroppi keeps a record of my exploration in Machine Learning, NLP and AI, and more specifically, some actionable practice in healthcare, marketing and insurance industry using open source data sets.


## P1 - NLP practice on Insurance QA corpus

### Data source

Insurance QA from [https://github.com/shuzi/insuranceQA]. This data set is originally for supervised QA purpose. However, it is often difficult to get such well organized and labeled data in real business world.

### Practice

Sales dialogue such as telemarketing contains many QA pairs like insurance QA data. Thus, some explorations to understand successful sales dialogue can be done using unsupervised learning in NLP. Practice includes some demo models built using medical insurance QA pairs.
