## Introduction

Basically, keroppi keeps a record of my exploration in Machine Learning, NLP and AI, and more specifically, some actionable practice in healthcare, marketing and insurance industry using open source data sets.


## P1 - NLP practice on Insurance QA corpus

### Data source

Insurance QA from [https://github.com/shuzi/insuranceQA]. This data set is originally for supervised QA purpose. However, it is often difficult to get such well organized and labeled data in real business world.
